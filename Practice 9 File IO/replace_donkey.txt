Once upon a time, in a small village, lived an old donkey named ghonchoo. He was known for his laziness, always avoiding work. One day, while wandering aimlessly, Juno stumbled upon a deep well. Curious, he peered inside and saw his reflection. Mistaking it for another donkey, ghonchoo brayed loudly, thinking he was being mocked. His loud noise alerted the villagers, who came rushing to save him. Grateful for their concern, ghonchoo realized that his laziness had nearly led him into trouble. From that day on, he worked hard and became the most dependable donkey in the village.
